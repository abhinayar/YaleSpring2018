# Problem Set 1

## Due Jan. 29th | Econ 444

1. Pfizer + Merck
	- a. 40% premium on 100/sh = **$140/sh**
	- b. 
		- 10% annual return then SP today = 170/1.10 = **154.54**
		- Risk neutral probability => 170(p) + 100(1-p) / 1.02 = 154.54.
		
			Thus the risk-neutral probability *p* ~= 0.8233 = **82.33%**
		
			Formula is: *Risk Neutral p = 1.02(current SP) - 100 / 70*
	- c. 
		- 8% annual return then SP today = 170/1.08 = **157.407**
		- Risk neutral probability = 1.02(157.407) - 100 / 70 = **86.507%**
	- d. 
		- 12% annual return then SP today = 170/1.12 = **151.7857**
		- R-neutral p = 1.02(151.7857) - 100 / 70 = **78.3163%**
	- e. 
		- a. 10% annual return = 170/(1.1^2) = **140.4958 (SP today)**
		
			Risk Neutral p = (1.02^2)(140.4958) - 100 / 70 = 0.6595 = **65.95%**
		- b. 8% annual return = 170/(1.08^2) = **145.747 (SP today)**
		
			Risk Neutral p = (1.02^2)(145.747) - 100 / 70 = **73.7645%**
		- c. 12% annual return = 170/(1.12^2) = **135.523 (SP today)**
			
			Risk Neutral p = (1.02^2)(135.523) - 100 / 70 = **58.568%**
	- f. 
		- a. 10% annual return = 170/1.10^(1/2) = **162.088 (SP today)**
			Risk Neutral p = (1.02^(1/2))(162.088) - 100 / 70 = **91.0018%**
		- b. 8% annual return = 170/1.08^(1/2) = **163.582 (SP Today)**
			Risk Neutral p = (1.02^(1/2))(163.582 - 100 / 70 = **93.156%*

		- c. 12% annual return = 170/1.12^(1/2) = **160.634 (SP Today)**

			Risk Neutral p = (1.02^(1/2))(160.634) - 100 / 70 = **88.903%**
	- g. Change the currency. PFE offers 3:1 shares. 3 PFE shares @ $50 SP = *$150 p. share effective offer price.* 

		10% risk premium : Price of MRK today would be: 150/1.12 = **133.928**
		
	- h. 5% risk premium : SP MRK today = 150/1.07 = **140.187**
	- i. 15% risk premium : SP MRK today = 150/1.17 = **128.205**
	- j. 2 years to complete:
		- j.g: 10% risk premium : SP MRK today = 150/(1.12^2) = **119.58**
		- j.h: 5% risk premium: SP MRK today = 150/(1.07^2) = **131.015**
		- j.i: 15% risk premium: SP MRK today = 150/(1.17^2) = **109.577**
	- k. 6 monhts to complete:
		- k.g: 10% risk premium : SP MRK today = 150/(1.12 ^ 1/2) = **141.7366**
		- k.h: 5% risk premium : SP MRK today = 150/(1.07 ^ 1/2) = **145.010**
		- k.i: 15% risk premium : SP MRK today = 150/(1.17 ^ 1/2) = **138.675**
	- l. Currency change: PFE offers $100 in 5 yrs. from date and 1 sh. PFE on closing.
	
		MRK trading price: 100/(1.07^5) + 50/(1.11) = 71.298 + 45.045 = **116.343** 
	- m. PFE wants MRK to trade at 150/sh post announcement. How many shares do they have to give sholders today?
	
		150 = 71.298 + X/1.11
		78.702 = X/1.11
		X = 87.359
		87.359 / 50 = 1.747

		Thus PFE will have to give current MRK shareholders 1.747 shares upon closing to have MRK trade at $150
	- n. PFE vs. JNJ
		
		PFE offer value: 150
		JNJ offer value: 150 OR 150/1.02 = 147.0588

		Solely based on the economics, the deals are identical as they can always choose the 150/sh sale price. But the JNJ deal might be superior to the shareholders because it gives them more options and a good deal if they believe in the future of JNJ and JNJ to be a superior company. 

		Economically however, the deals are identical.
	- o. The deals are equivalent, and the only difference is the shareholders respective views on the future health of PFE vs. JNJ.
	- p. MRK shareholders would choose the JNJ debt, because it has a higher NPV. MRK stock would trade at 150/1.02 = **147.058**


2. PFE + Valeant
	- USD -> CAD exchng rate: 1:1.25
	- US/CA interest rates are the same 
	
	What price does Valeant have to offer?

	PFE offer: 150
	**Valeant offer: 150(1.25) = 187.5 CAD/sh cash**
 
3. Assume:
	- CAD int rates: 10%
	- US int. rates: 0%
	
	PFE Bid: 150
	Valeant Bid : (X/1.1) > 187.5, thus they must bid: **X = 206.25/sh CAD**

4. PFE vs. KKR
	- KKR will raise funds. 
	- 20% chance of failure, 80% chance of success raising funds
	- If KKR cannot raise, bid fails.
	- MRK chooses KKR and failure, then MRK = 100, PFE bid = gone
	- MRK investors want to max. the expec. value of takeover offer

	Min. cash bid needed to compete with PFE?

	KKR must bid enough to cover the risk of the transaction so: 0.8(X) = 150, thus **X = 187.5**

5. Assume inv. do not know the prob. KKR is able to finance the bid. 
	- MRK inv. require 25% return during 1yr if KKR bid accep.
	- MRK inv. require 10% ret. during 1yr if PFE bid accep.

	**If PFE bid = 150, what does KKR have to bud to have MRK trade at same level it would today with PFE's bid?**

	MRK w/ PFE bid trades at : 136.3636
	KKR has to bid: X/1.25 > 136.3636 = 170.4545

	KKR must bid at least **170.4545** to have MRK trade at PFE levels.

	

	**Assume the stock falls back to $100 if the deal fails. What is the implied prob. of completion for the KKR offer if the 1 yr risk free rate = 5%?**

	KKR bid: 170.4545
	MRK price today: 136.3636
	MRK price on failure: 100

	Probability of completion: p(170.4545/1.05) + (1-p)(100/1.05) = 136.3636

	(162.337 - 95.238))p = 41.1256

	67.099(p) = 41.1256

	**p = 0.6129  = 61.29%**

	Thus the implied prob. of completion is *61.29%*
