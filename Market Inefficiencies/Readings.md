Economics of Hedge Fund Orgs:

-  What is the problem in front of a money manager?
  - Managers believe they have &gt; avg strategies
  - Needs external capital
  - Debt or Equity financing required
    - ■■Managers personal wealth is not usually enough to finance a fund
    - ■■So usually equity
    - ■■Fund as only practical option
  - Fund man. With WINNING strategies obv. Dont want to disclose the strats that helped them win
    - ■■But where does transp. Come into the equation for public AND inv.
    - ■■Leads to lack of publicly offered hedge fund products
  - Hedge fund = large profit but highly leveraged
    - ■■High risk, high reward
    - ■■Inv. want lim liability
  - If fund were formed as an LLC, taxes become annoying
    - ■■That&#39;s why usually they&#39;re lim. Partnerships

Summary of Hedge Fund Inv. Styles

- Returns char. Diff. strats
  - 7 main chars.
    - ■■Event driven styles
      - Distressed Securities Funds
        - Take bets on corp. BK&#39;s, reorgs, bank debt and high yield corp bonds
      - Merger Arbitrage
        - Invest in announced M&amp;A
        - Long the equities of targets and short the acquirer
          - ■■Reverse if deal may fail
    - ■■Global Funds
      - Catch all cat inv. In NON US stocks and bonds
        - No SPEC. strat but just generally diversified global inv.
      - Macro funds rely on macro analysis to bet on MAJOR risks:
        - Currencies
        - Int Rates
        - Stock Indices
        - Commodities
    - ■■Market Neutral Funds
      - Avoid major risk factors
        - Bet on rel. Price movements
        - Lot of attempted arbitrage:
          - ■■Long-short arbit., stock index arbit, conv. Bond arbit., fixed income arbit.
      - Long-Short Funds:
        - Classic AW Jones model, taking long/short pos. And limiting exposure
      - Stock Index Arbit Funds:
        - Trade the spread between index futures contracts and underlying basket of equities
      - Conv Bond Arbit:
        - Trade embedded options in the bonds and short the equities they are assoc. With
      - Fixed Income Arbit:
        - Trade the price of the bond along a yield curve
        - Mix of corp and gov bonds and two baskets of sim. Bonds trading at price diff.
    - ■■Sector Funds
      - Inv. in SPECIFIC SECTORS of the economy
      - Long only funds vs short-seller funds
  - Trading techniques above are not limited to hedge funds
    - ■■Universities, rich families, etc. all use it to trade
  - IS THERE and overall framework allowing investors to compare diff. Funds performance on a risk adjusted basis GIVEN all these diff. Trading strats? (BIG QUESTION)
    - ■■We begin by constructing a framework that relates inv. Targets to asset allocation decisions
      - TWO approaches:
      - 1. Relative Return
        - Rel. targets are selected the universe of asset indices like SP500, become benchmarks
        - Target ret can be pos. Or neg based on benchmark
      - 2. Absolute Target Return
        - Fixed target ahead of time
        - Indp. of the market performance
      - Typically hedge funds are absolute target based
        - Supposed to deliver regardless of prevailing market conditions
      - TWO BROAD APPROACHES:
        - 1. MT (Market Timing)
          - ■■Bets on the direction of markets dynamically
          - ■■Long OR short markets to capture the rise and fall in realtime
          - ■■Directional, RISK SEEKING approach
          - ■■Large rewards
        - 2. ND (Non-Directional)
          - ■■Extracts value from the set of diverse arbit opps.
          - ■■Tries to exploit structural def. Of markets
          - ■■Tries to eliminate systematic risk
          - ■■Low volatility approach and returns are like high yield bonds without int rate/credit risk
      - MT AND ND show low/0 correlation with most market indices
        - As long as the markets are not CONTINUOUSLY upward the MT will sometimes have a neg. Cor with std. Market indices
        - Bc they switch long/short positions on the fly
        - ND approach on the other hand seks profits without betting on market trends so it has VERY LOW corr. With the market movement
      - Hybrid style used by EVENT DRIVEN FUNDS
        - Managers try to hedge systemic risk there is still risk here that wont get you as low as ND styles
        - Less volatile than MT

Quantitative Char. of Hedge Fund Inv. Styles

- Fung/Hsieh built a quant. Class. Scheme based on returns alone
- If two managers use same strat on same markets then returns are corr to each other (but not market necesarilly)
- We use PCA to group funds based on corr. With each other
  - First 5 PC&#39;s explain 45% of variation in the hedge fund returns
- PC&#39;s:
  - 1. Funds that apply a trend following strategy on div. Markets
  - 2. Global/Macro Funds
  - 3. Long-Only funds
  - 4. Trend following style with emph. On currency
  - 5. Distressed sec. Funds
- Some interesting results:
  - Div. benefits exist for MT funds
  - ⅘ PC&#39;s are MARKET TIMERS
  - Market Neutral/ND funds tend ot fall into the unexplained cat. Of PC&#39;s

Return Char. of Trend Following CTA&#39;s

- Hypothesis: It is dynamic nature of trading strats that make hedge fund returns appear to be uncorr. With market returns
  - Despite the fact that the funds exist in these markets
- Trend following is term used by MOST CTA&#39;s to desc. Trading style
- Trading strats are prop., most places use mechanical trading rules for large pr. Movements
- CTAs do best during volatile times in US economy vs rel. Calm times
  - Behaves as though it owns straddles on US equities
- CTAs tend to not prefer stocks, then question is how do they generate option like returns
  - Lookback straddles
    - ■■Unreal options… you get to buy the option at the LOWEST point of the stock vs the exercise price during the period of the option (opposite for put)
    - ■■Owner of a lookback STRADDLE ( lookback call = lookback put ) receives diff. Between LOWEST price and highest price

Return Chars. Of Global/Macro Funds

- Most of the large hedge funds (&gt; $1B) are GLOBAL/MACRO funds
- Funds take a concentrated leveraged bet on MAJOR global events
  - Based on fund. Econ beliefs
- Returns are affected by RANDOM arrival of major econ events and accuracy of judegments
  - Ability to take bets outside equity markets lets these funds make profits when US economy is quiet

Return Chars. Of Fixed Income Arbitrage

- Returns are insensitive to US equities
- 1% per month, 12% per year with low vol.
- Seems to be some sort of disaster insurance
- Basically you get equity like returns WITHOUT the same risk -&gt; Equity like returns with bond like volatility.

Conclusion:

- Hedge funds and CTA funds have diff. risk/return profiles than mutual funds
- Diff. in investment style and trading strats
- Diff. reg. Env

**READING 2:**

**HEDGE FUNDS AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE: IS THE SEC TELLING SECRETS**

- 1934 Sec. echng. Act requires many hedge fund managers to publicly disclose their holdings
- Could be taken as violating 5th amendment
- SEC 2004: Over 7000 hedge funds op. In USA, 870B in assets
  - 2007: 1.4T industry
  - Rapid growth, not much regulation
- SEC new rule: Hedge fund managers with &gt; 25M in assets have to reg. With SEC
  - Strong opp.
  - Rule challenged in court
  - No rule standing curr.
- Question: Are hedge fund holdings trade secrets? Is it infringement on private property to require disclosure?

WHAT ARE HEDGE FUNDS:

- Term has no uniform def.
- Any proff. Managed pool of assets sued to invest/trade in equities/securities
- Lim partnerships and manager is the gen partner
- Avoiding reg. With SEC allows managers to charge performance fee on top of management fees
- Inv. advisors with  &gt; 100M must reg with SEC and publicly available
  - Tho they can apply for secret filing, SEC rarely accepts
  - Confidential treatment is rare
  - Must demonstrate this treatment is in the public interest
  - Even Warren Buffet has been denied

Do Hedge Funds hold trade secrets?

- Logic for protection follows from patens:
  - People will not dev. Certain forms of information at private cost if the benefit of info can be socialized (tragedy of the commons)
- Unlike patents and copyrights, trade secrets are protected by STATE LAW
- Trade Secret:
  - Any information that can be used in the operation of a business or other enterprise and that is sufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential economic advantage over others
  - Under this def, arguments can be made that hedge fund advisors have trade secrets
- Holdings and positions reveal op. Of fund
  - Altho fund strat should be based on public info, the holding rep a thesis of the advisor
  - Takes research, efforts and network
  - This creates some value and is reflected in the perf. And management fees paid to the manager
- Arguments can be made that mutual fund advisors and ANY money managers have trade secrets
  - BUT a trade secret must be a SECRET to qualify lol
  - Mutual funds cant have secret holdings by the Adviser Act Rule 206(4)
  - Mutual fund managers delib. Allow free access to others to duplicate the funds investment
- Hedge fund managers wishing to remain unreg. Must go through several exceptions in the law
  - &lt; 100M in sec.

Trade Secrets &amp; Const. Protection:

- 5th amendment TAKINGS clause says:
  - Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation
- BUT does it even apply to &quot;trade secrets&quot; of the hedge funds?
  - (1) Has private property been taken?
  - (2) Was there just. For taking the prop.
  - (3) Was it taken for public use?
  - (4) Has compensation been provided?

CONCLUSION:

- As SEC pushes for more reg. Of hedge funds, the managers will push back to avoid reg.
- IP law may be the next basis for blocking the SEC
- 5th Amendment will come into question, as well as the nature of hedge fund disclosures and its broader effect on the public/markets themselves.gma

**WEEK 2 READINGS:
Characteristics Of Risk &amp; Return in Risk Arbitrage**

- Paper analyzed 4750 M&amp;A deals from 63 to 98 to char. The risk and return in risk arbit.
- Risk arbit ret are + corr. With market ret in dep markets but uncorr. In flat and apprec. Markets
- Returns similar to those obtained from selling uncovered index put options

START

- After the announcement of M&amp;A deal, target co. stock typically trades at a discount to price offered by acquiring co.
- Diff. between acq. Price and trading price is the ARBITRAGE SPREAD
- If the merger is succ. Then the inv. Captures the spread in profit
  - If it falls through, then loss
- Research findings suggest that financial markets have a SYS INNEF in pricing firms involved in M&amp;A deals
- Two expl:
  - (a) Transaction costs prevent inv. From taking full advantage of the spread so they are compensated extra to make up for it
  - (b) The inv. Are compensated for the risk of deal failure
- Argument:
  - Owning tget co. stock after tender offer is like owning tget stock + put option on tget stock
  - CAPM does not fully capture the risk assoc. With deal failure and overstates potential returns
- Paper investigates wether the reason the CAPM or other linear asset pricing models FAIL to capture the risk from inv. In merger stocks is that the ret to merger stocks are corr. To market returns in a non linear way (thus linear pricing will not work)
