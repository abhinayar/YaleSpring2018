_Investment Advisor Act of 1940_

- --Defines types of investors allowed to invest in pooled investment vehicles
- --Managers of these are regulated by SEC
- --SEC looks at products they have
- --Until recently Hedge funds did not have to register with the SEC

_Investment Company Act of 1940_

- --Controls the company, as opposed to just the advisor
- --30&#39;s with new deal you see big regulations of securities
- --SEC is created in late 30s
- --All the reg. About how to issue equity and trade it, etc.

The 40 acts were the end of that process

When they were written the assumption was that it was going to cover EVERYTHING

 Meant to control investment companies

 &gt; 40% of revenue through investments count as inv. Companies

 BUT there is a break/exception for companies that have a FEW people and few investors

  This has now become an enormous sector

**Liquidity:** How quickly you can sell the assets under management

**NAV:** Net asset value.
