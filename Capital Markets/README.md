Prof. Gary Gorton

- --No case answers, not enough cases but will go over some in class
- --If your name is on a case, you are responsible for it
- --2 Exams, Review session before
  - --30% each
- --Going to go over everything you need to operate in financial markets
  - --Pricing models, financials, etc.
  - --Credit risk, financial stuff, securitization

**Modigliani-Miller Theorem**

- Assumptions:
  - No taxes
  - Earnings are perpetuities
  - All earnings are paid out as dividends
  - Only debt financing
  - Etc. (look up simple MM assumptions)
- Proof:
  - To prove MM we rely on arbit arguments

- Question we&#39;re exploring: DOES IT MATTER WHAT TYPE OF SEC. A FIRM ISSUES?
  - How to find?
    - ■■Use CAPM to find Alpha + Beta value in CAPM model
    - ■■Then average out over any historical data of issuance of a certain security
    - ■■Take this average and calc error rate and test for stat. Significance
  - Basically this will give us an Average Abnormal Return for diff. Types of securities
    - ■■Diff. types DO cause different effects
    - ■■This violates MM theorem (but we already knew that was just an abstraction)
- Does BK Matter?
  - Costs of financial distress
    - ■■Hard to determine
  - Costs of issuing debt?
    - ■■Large cost
      - Personnel cost
      - Legal cost
      - Etc. etc.

Summary:

- MM does not hold (not in basic form)
- No arbitrage
- Event studies, abnormal returns
- Bankruptcy costs


## LECTURE 2

**Fixed incom mathematics**

- Prices and yields:
	- Bond price if fundamental
	- If you know price you can calc. yield
	- Yield, or YTM is a way to express the bond price as an annualized INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN
	- Another way to express value
	- Yields can be misleading bc measures of relative value

- Pricing:
	- Price of bonds is usually quoted per $100 face value (NO bonds sold for that small an amount). 
	- Most US markets, coupons are paid twice a year- 6 mo. is NATURAL time
	- Bond has maturity of N 6-Mo. periods
	- Coupon (C) refers to cash paid in six months
	- Coupon rates are stated as annual rates, but US bonds are paid semi annually
	- Price of bond is PV of bonds cash flow: 
		- Price = C/(1+y/2) + C/(1+y/2)^2 + ... + (100 + C)/(1+y/2)^n

		- C == $ amount of the coupon paid after each 6 mo.
		- Coupon rate = c (little c) is the annual rate
		- Actual coupon (C) is the coupon rate * the face value / 2
		- y = the bonds yield

- The YIELD:
	- Suppose bond has 8.5% coupon rate, 1.5yrs to maturity. Coupon is paid semi annually and TODAY is a coupon date. Price of vond is 1.043066. What is the yield.
	- 1.043066 = (0.0425/(1+y/2)) + (0.0425/(1+y/2)^2) + (1 + 0.0425/(1+y/2)^3), solve for y

- Technical NOTE:
	- Yield is only realized if the bond is held till maturity and if all the coupons are reinvested at the SAME rate as the yield
	- In practice this does not happen bc diff. bonds have diff. yields and also funds are rarely re-invested at the exact same rate

- Conversions of compounding frequency:
	- Forumla for changing from annual to n-period:
	- Effective Period Rate = (1+annual rate)^(1/n) - 1
	- Can also reverse these forumulas

- Zero coupon bonds and discount factors
	- Simplest bond is a riskless zero coupon bond
	- Only pays the principal at the maturity date
	- NO dfault risk, still has other risk (interest rate risk)
	- Easy to calculate price, just discount the final date/# of periods and the face value back to present day
	- Yield in this scenario is special bc no coupon payments..., basically hr risk free rate (this is how it's usually calculated I think)
- Discount Factor	
	- Price of a claim to one dollar in N 6-mo. periods
	- z_n = Pn/100 = 1/(1+y_n/2)^n
	- Discount factor uses PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1 DOLLAR

- Yield Conventions
	- Yield conventions are arbit sets of rules for computing yields
	- US treasuries use semi annual
	- We can also do annual, k-compounding, continuous compounding, simple interest and discount basis (each has its own way of calculating the discount factor)
	- Euro bonds typically have annual coupons

- Riskless Coupon Bonds
	- TO BE CONTINUED

- Question: What does it mean that the price is quoted for the principal amt of $100?
