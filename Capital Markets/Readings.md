**Homework #1: Lloyd's Coco Bonds**

*Readings*

Deutche Coco bonds plumbing new lows:
- German lenders RISKIEST bonds plummeted 
- Bad start ot the year for the CONTINGENT CONV. BOND market
- Shaped by regulators to transfer risk to markets in the aftermath of a crisis
- Coco bonds, sold by banks, count as TIER 1 CAPITAL
- Coco bonds convert to equity when the issuers capital falls to a certain level
- THIS IS 2016!!!!
- CEO Deutsche Bank said bank will prioritise coco coupon payments
	- Payed for with same reserves used for dividends/bonuses
- Markets are HIGHLY TECHNICAL
	- Not included in major indices
	- Weakening support when price falls
- No bank has defaulted on a coco bond and losses are in secondary markets


An Experiment In The Role of Contingent Capital:
- UK reg. are experiementing with somethign that could redef. banking finance
- Lloys Banking Group raising 21BN 
	- UK gov has 43% stake
	- Launched offer for holders of HYBRID DEBT to exchng into new notes; ENHANCED CAPITAL NOTES
	- ECNs
- ECNs = Contingent Convertibles = CoCo Bonds
	- Hope is that they will appeal to inv 
	- Comfort for regulators over their loss absorbing cap.
- KEY FEATURE:
	- Pays coupons like normal bond, conv. automatically into shares if the banks core tier 1 ration falls < 5%
	- Tier 1 ratio is the ratio of banks core EQUITY CAPITAL to its total RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAs)
	- What?
		- Tier 1 is CORE capital
		- Also have TIER 2: Supplementary capital
		- Basically tier1 ratio is the measure of FINANCIAL STRENGTH based on sum of capital and disclosed reserves
		- Ratio of CORE equity capital to total of ALL assets hed by the bank, wieghted by credit risk (regulator def. formula)

- CoCo is replacing Hybrid Debt
	- Subordinate debt instruments with EQUITY LIKE features 
	- Loss absorbing tier 1 cap
	- Regulators are not satisfied bc they are not suff. loss absorbing in stress times
- Coco's offer holders liquidity in the event of a downturn which they dont have with Hybrid debt
	- Hybrid debt is debt that combines both debt + equity charts.
	- Conv. bond is an example
	- Typically pay a rate of return (fixed or floating) until a certain date (same as bonds)


Deutsche Bank Research: Contingent Convertibles
- Following financial crisis, min. req. of debt instruments that can be counted towards reg. capital are being adjusted
- Banks will have to bring cap. in line with new reg. requirements
- CoCo is next gen subordinate bonds
	- Coco is a new type of conv. bond that is conv into predefined # of shares when a threshold is crossed
- Conclusion:
	- For banks, the bond market will undergo much change in coming yrs
	- Coco's only make sense when tailored to indiv. situation


**AND NOW WE FINALLY GET TO THE FUCKING HOMEWORK**

*Homework #1: 
Lloyd's CoCo Bonds*

**1. What is going on in the proposed transaction? What is the structure of this bond?**

Lloyd's banking group are offering to exchange their current debt holders securities for ECN (Enhanced Capital Notes), or Contingenet Convertible (CoCo) notes which will also pay a coupon rate but can be redeemed once a material/converion trigger event occers for a predefined/determined equity stake (helping keep the debtholders liquid in the event of a downturn)

**2. These ECNs are also known as contignent convertible, or CoCo bonds. What is a CoCo bond?**

A Coco bond is a Continent Convertible bond. It is a debt security that acts like a bond and pays a coupon rate, but that ALSO converts into a predefined amount of equity when a certainc criteria or threshold is met (for example, when the banks tier 1 ratio falls below 5%)

**3. What are the main features of LLoyd's proposed CoCo bond? How do they differ from straightforward corporate bonds?**

Main features are a fixed rate of interest between 1.5 and 2.5%. There is also a mandatory conversion of the ECN into new and/or existing ordinary shares and the ECN is credited at that point as fully paid. The conversion will be at a price prevelant on the relevant conversion date.

They are basically striaghtforward corporate bonds that clear on Euroclean and Clearstream, with pricing schedules and the like, BUT they also have a trigger/material event that will cause the ECNs to convert into a predefined % equity stake in the company. 


**4. What is the conversion trigger? If the trigger is hit what happens?**

Conversion trigger is if LBG's consolidated core tier 1 ratio is less than 5%. Consolidated core tier 1 ration means the ratio of core tier 1 capital of LBG to the risk weighted assets of LBG (calculated on a consolidated basis).

What happens? The ECNs will be converted in whole to the pre-agreed equity. Issuer can now dedeem the ECNs at a price equal to their principal amount. 

**5. What is the point of this exchange offer? What is "GAPS"?**

GAPS is the Government Asset Protection Scheme. GAPS is an insurance designed to help banks with a lot of bad loads. Banks capital base is under threat and they are cutting back on issuing loans and government needs them to issue the loans.

Purpose of the exchange offer is so that LBG can meet its current and long term capital requirements. The proposal is that the banks current debtholders/holders of LBG's debt securities will be invited to exchange their assets for either new lower tier 2 qualifying bonds, or the new CoCo bonds (or ECNs).

**6. What is a covenant? Under the covenants, can Lloyds issue equity?**

A covenant is a promise in a debt agreement that certain activities will not be carried out (via Google). Covenants usually limit how much more debt can be issued by the bond/debt issuer. 

Under the covenant, I'm honestly pretty unclear in between the legalese whether LBG can issue equity. It seems that they can issue shares to people who already have rights, to employees and as part of incentive packages, and that they must issue shares at at least 95% spot value, but other than that I think they are free to issue shares (though I could be wrong).

**7. What is the governing law for Coco bonds?**

The governing law for the Coco bonds is Scots law.

**8. WHat is the "Business Day Convention" for the bonds? What does that mean?**

The business day convention says that if the ECNs are triggered on a day that is NOT a business day then a set of rules would kick in (the convention) that would dictate which days price the ECNs converted on.

**9. What is the clearing system for Cocos? What does "clearing" mean? What is "ClearStream"?**

The ECNs have been accepted for clearing by EuroClear and Clearstream, Luzembourd. 

Clearing is when a third party acts as an intermediary in a financial transaction, acting as a buyer and a seller to reconcile the true buyers/sellers orders.

Clearstream is a service from Deutsche bank that provides settlement and custody for securities across all asset classes. It is one of the two European International Central Securities Dopositories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearstream)

**10. What is the bulk of the Memordandum about?**

The bulk of the memorandum is about the details of the ECN, the Appendix (specifically the ECN pricing schedules), and a lot of background/review information about LBG, HBOS Group, and financial information.

**11. What is the "Pricing Schedule"? What is the difference betwen the schedule on page 214-15, and 216-17? Why are there so many diff. pricing schedules?**

The difference between the two pricing schedules is because they deal with different due dates of the ECNs (one is due 2020, other 2019).

The pricing schedule is the document that sets out the terms and conditions of the rate of interest, the coupon rate, and various other financial details of the ECN.

**12. Who exactly is issuing these bonds?**

LBG Capital No. 1 plc is the issuer of the bonds

**13. Appendix 8 gives recent prices of existing securities. What do the numbers mean? Do they seem low or high?**

The numbers are where the price of the recent shares and securities have been trading compared to their issued price. The numbers below 100 mean that the price of the securities has fallen a considerable amount from when they were issued.
