**Modigliani-Miller Theorem**

- Assumptions:
  - No taxes
  - Earnings are perpetuities
  - All earnings are paid out as dividends
  - Only debt financing
  - Etc. (look up simple MM assumptions)
- Proof:
  - To prove MM we rely on arbit arguments

- Question we&#39;re exploring: DOES IT MATTER WHAT TYPE OF SEC. A FIRM ISSUES?
  - How to find?
    - ■■Use CAPM to find Alpha + Beta value in CAPM model
    - ■■Then average out over any historical data of issuance of a certain security
    - ■■Take this average and calc error rate and test for stat. Significance
  - Basically this will give us an Average Abnormal Return for diff. Types of securities
    - ■■Diff. types DO cause different effects
    - ■■This violates MM theorem (but we already knew that was just an abstraction)
- Does BK Matter?
  - Costs of financial distress
    - ■■Hard to determine
  - Costs of issuing debt?
    - ■■Large cost
      - Personnel cost
      - Legal cost
      - Etc. etc.

Summary:

- MM does not hold (not in basic form)
- No arbitrage
- Event studies, abnormal returns
- Bankruptcy costs
